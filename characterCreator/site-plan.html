			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>As a hardcore tabletop roleplaying gamer, I appreciate that making new characters is difficult. Specifically, I run Call of Cthulhu oneshots for my group, and I'm tired of helping people with making characters. 
               So.... I'm going to take advantage of this project to build a online Call of Cthulhu Character creation helper. We'll see how much I add for this, maybe it'll just be skill choosing, but I'm going to make my life easier while doing homework. 
            </p>

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>My tabletop group. That's it. <br/>
                I suspect that this would also be useful to those who also play Call of Cthulhu. It's hard to make characters for it, as it's a complex system, so having something that makes it easier will be nice for those people I expect. 
            </p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>The main dynamic elements will be the skill calculator. It will store an array of all the skills that the character can take, and allow them to adjust the skills up to their max skill amount. It will also display the "level" of each skill a player has put points in (Unskilled, Amateur, PHD, etc)
            </p>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
